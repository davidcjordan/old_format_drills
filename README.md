# boomer_drills
Drill configuration files in an obsolete format.  The current format uses CSV files.

These drills were converted from Boomer 1 format. There are many, many duplicate files and it's difficult to determine which ones are the ones customers really use.

There wasn't a lot of validation (input checking of these drills).

The rotary format changed in the new file format to include more rotary steps.

In summary, this repository can be deleted at some time.
